Simple script to create a matrix JSON file based on specific drivers versions for specific kernel versions.

`config.json` should be configured as follows:
vendor_dir - Directory under root where outputs will be saved. source_dir and data_dir should be under it.
driver_url - Where JSON for driver versions can be downloaded
kernel_url - Where JSON for kernel versions can be downloaded
source_dir - Where downloaded JSON files will be saved
data_dir - Where matrix JSON files will be saved
